## Key Projects

- [**PDF Link Check**](https://github.com/City-of-Memphis-Wastewater/pdflinkcheck) - Now available on the [Microsoft Store](https://apps.microsoft.com/detail/9n11hxvls1wg).
- [**Pipeline**](https://github.com/City-of-Memphis-Wastewater/pipeline-eds) — Python modules and daemons for EDS sensor data transmission and API integration with third parties. This short [*video*](https://youtube.com/shorts/V6690KY2tao) helps to elucidate the intent and scope of the Pipeline project, and it also includes footage of a web server being run from Termux on Android to display a live data plot on local host.
- [**PyHabitat**](https://github.com/City-of-Memphis-Wastewater/pyhabitat) - Introspective build and environment assessment library. One focus is underserved Termux on Android and iSH on iOS, which require special consideration due to limitations with GUI and **pip** installation. The `environment.py` file began in the **pavlov3D** project, saw action in the **pipeline** project, and now has been realized as a dedicated utility library.
- [**Dworshak CLI**](https://github.com/City-of-Memphis-Wastewater/dworshak): The CLI tool for saving credentials securely, to the Dworshak vault database.
- [**dworshak-access**](https://github.com/City-of-Memphis-Wastewater/dworshak-access): The Python library for retreiving and scripting with securely stored Dworshak credenetials.

<!--- [**xlimsprep**](https://github.com/City-of-Memphis-Wastewater/xlimsprep) — A Pythonic pandas and tkinter utility for sanitizing and plotting data exported from the X-LIMS system.-->
